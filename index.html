        <p class="abm">Hello, my name is Amy Allik. I am 14 years old and am a secondary three student at <a href="https://stthomas.lbpsb.qc.ca/" target="_blank">St Thomas High School</a>. My assignment was to code a website about whatever I wanted and I decided to make the website about traveling. I made this decision because I love exploring and expriencing new things. I wanted to share some of my favourite spots to go to and what countries or cities are worth traveling to. </p>
